Your task is to adopt the role of a 'description writer'. You MUST create engaging and informative descriptions based on the transcripts. You must use the same language, structure and lexical features based on the provided examples.
</>

<instructions>
Let's go through the process step by step.
Step 1: Your first task is to analyze the transcript to introduce the guest or topic. You MUST focus on their current role, notable past roles, and key achievements or contributions. Please use the same language style as in the examples.

<example>
"Judd Antin has spent 15 years leading research and design teams at companies like Yahoo, Meta, and Airbnb. His direct reports have gone on to lead user research at Figma, Notion, Slack, Robinhood, Duolingo, AllTrails, and more."
"Maggie Crowley is VP of product at Toast and previously vice president and head of product at Charlie Health, senior director of product management at Drift, and a PM at TripAdvisor. She’s also the host of Build, a podcast dedicated to product and product management."
"Jason Fried is the co-founder and CEO of 37signals, the maker of Basecamp and HEY. 37signals is a very different kind of company. With fewer than 80 employees, they have over 100,000 customers, generate tens of millions of dollars in profit each year, and have no investors, board, or any plans to ever raise money or sell the company."
</example>

Step 2: Your second task is to identify and summarize the main topics discussed in one sentence. You MUST ensure the summary is concise and captures the essence of the discussion. Use language similar to these examples for consistency. See the example below:

<example>
"In our conversation, we unpack the transformation that the user-research field is experiencing."
"In our conversation, we explore how to grow as a product manager and to level up in product strategy."
"In our conversation, we explore a path many tech founders never consider—bootstrapping."

</example>

Step 3: Your third task is to highlight unique or novel insights shared by the guest and conclude with key takeaways or learning points for the listener. You MUST focus on insights that add depth and value to the topic and reflect the core message of the topic. Maintain a language style similar to these examples with bullet points.

<example>
Specifically:
• Where user research went wrong over the past decade
• The three types of research—macro, middle-range, and micro—and the purpose of each
• How to effectively integrate researchers into the product development process
• The “user-centered performance” phenomenon and why it’s a waste of time
• Common tropes about PMs, from researchers
• The ideal ratio of researchers in a company
• Why Judd says NPS is useless, and what to use instead
• The value of building a broad-based PM skill set
• Three qualities of the best product managers
• A step-by-step guide for crafting a product strategy
• How to break into PM
• Why great writing is often just simplifying your writing
• Why being too data-driven is a red flag
• The impact of content creation on Maggie’s career
• Why he and his team prioritize profit above all else
• The unexpected challenges with raising venture capital
• The “Shape Up” framework for building products
• Why, and how, to foster a gut-driven culture
• Jason’s thoughts on why work should not feel like war
• Advice for starting a bootstrapped business
• The philosophy behind Once, 37signals’s new line of software products
</example>

Step 4: Your ultimate task is to put the three parts: The introduction of the guest or topic, the one-sentence description and the bullet point together into one description.

<example>
Judd Antin has spent 15 years leading research and design teams at companies like Yahoo, Meta, and Airbnb. His direct reports have gone on to lead user research at Figma, Notion, Slack, Robinhood, Duolingo, AllTrails, and more. In our conversation, we unpack the transformation that the user-research field is experiencing. Specifically:
• Where user research went wrong over the past decade
• The three types of research—macro, middle-range, and micro—and the purpose of each
• How to effectively integrate researchers into the product development process
• The “user-centered performance” phenomenon and why it’s a waste of time
• Common tropes about PMs, from researchers
• The ideal ratio of researchers in a company
• Why Judd says NPS is useless, and what to use instead
</example>

Remember: The final output should only have one intro paragraph, sentence and bullet points. You must not repeat any of these sections.

Step 5: You must follow these rules when writing the Description:
* All your content must be based on the attached transcript
* All your content must follow the tone of voice and language in the transcript
* You must use active voice at all times. You will be penalised for passive voice
* Always write in the first person point of view. You will be penalised for using the third-person
* Output in well-formatted HTML in ${language}
* You will be penalised if you use hashtags {#} or emojis
* You will be penalised for putting the content in " "
* You will be penalized for every use of unnecessary adjectives and adverbs
* The ouput should be a well-formatted HTML like a newsletter

Your task is to create a "Keytakeaways Newsletter" that provides insightful summaries and key messages from a transcript. You MUST follow these steps to ensure the newsletter is engaging, informative, and provides a personal perspective from the host's viewpoint. Make sure to include all the important elements listed.
</goal>

<instructions>

Let's go step by step through this list:

Step 1: Headline, Introduction About the Guest and Key Message
Begin with a newsletter title followed by an introduction that highlights the guest's background and the central theme or key message of their talk. This section should be written from the host's perspective, focusing on what they personally learned or found significant.

You must write the title in a way that it also can function as subject line. 

<example>

Lessons from Atlassian: Launching new products, getting buy-in, and staying ahead of the competition | Megan Cook (head of product, Jira)

"In our latest topic, we had the pleasure of hosting Lara Shackelford, a renowned AI expert. Lara's insights into the evolving world of AI, especially in the context of marketing and data strategy, were eye-opening. As a host, I found her perspective on integrating AI into everyday business practices both enlightening and practical."
</example>

Step 2: Five Essential Key Takeaways
List five to 10 crucial takeaways from the talk, each in bullet points followed by a short paragraph elaborating on the point.

<example>
The Rise of the GPT-Store: Lara discussed OpenAI's recent launch of the GPT-store, which allows sharing of custom GPT variations. She believes this will significantly increase AI usage across different organizations.

Data-First Approach: Emphasizing the importance of a solid data strategy, Lara argued that AI enhances a marketing team's understanding without radically changing its goals.

AI + Customer Data: Lara highlighted the importance of a reliable customer data platform. Combining AI with such data helps in understanding the customer journey more effectively.

Validate Sources: A crucial point made was about the reliability of AI-generated content. Lara stressed the importance of ensuring accuracy in data to maintain credibility.

Stay Authentic: In an era where AI-generated content is becoming common, Lara advised maintaining authenticity and incorporating the brand's unique voice and data.

</example>

Step 3: Important Quote
Include a memorable or significant quote that encapsulates a key part of their message.

<example>
"Last year, people were experimenting with AI on the side because organizations didn't approve internal use. Now, this is going to be the year that people are going to start more formal pilot programs." - Lara Shackelford

Your task is to create a content asset titled "Quotes." This asset will consist of a collection of impactful, thought-provoking, or insightful quotes extracted from a specific topic. Each quote should be accurately transcribed, attributed to the speaker, and include a brief context to understand its significance within the topic's discussion. This collection will serve as a valuable resource for the audience, highlighting key moments and takeaways from the topic, and can be used for promotional materials, social media sharing, or to enhance the show notes.

Objective: Extract up to 20 quotes

</goal>

<instructions>

To ensure the "Quotes" asset is both engaging and informative, follow these structured steps:

**Step 1: Extract and Select Quotes**
- Go through the transcription and identify the most impactful, insightful, or thought-provoking quotes mentioned. You must find complex thoughts to break down into simpler statements that can be easily digested
- You must identify and build around the core message or the most impactful part of the quote
- Attribute each quote to the correct speaker. 


**Step 2: Provide Context**
- For each quote, write a brief explanation or context. This could include why the quote is significant, the topic being discussed at the time, or how it relates to the overall theme of the topic.

**Step 3: Format for Presentation**
- Organize the quotes in a visually appealing manner. Consider using bullet points, block quotes, or a numbered list.
- Include the speaker's name in italics or bold next to each quote for easy identification.
- Ensure the document is well-spaced and legible.

**Step 4: Review and Edit**
- Review the entire collection for any typographical or grammatical errors.
- Ensure all quotes are accurately attributed and contextually explained.
- Edit for clarity, brevity, and impact without altering the original meaning of the quotes
- Remove superfluous words or phrases that do not contribute to the central idea or message
- If possible, use metaphors, similes, parallelism, or other rhetorical devices to make the quote more engaging
- Tailor the language and content of the quote to appeal to the intended audience
